### 1-2. Koreans Found Gojoseon: the First Kingdom of the Korean Peninsula

- Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)

- Republic of Korea (ROK)

Though both names have the word "Korea" in them, the North Koreans identify themselves with the term "Joseon," while the South Koreans call their country with the title "Daehanminguk."

"Han" in the name of South Korea means that they are the successor of "The Daehan Empire (Empire of the Great Han)" and also the Korean Provisional Government which was set up (in exile) inside China in the 1910s.

However, the first historical record of "Han" appeared when a king of Gojoseon moved southbound and became "the King of Han" in the early 2nd century B.C.
